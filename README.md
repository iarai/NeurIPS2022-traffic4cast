## Competition Description
Our Traffic4cast competition series at NeurIPS has contributed both methodological and practical insights to advance the application of AI to forecasting traffic and other spatial processes. Now, going beyond the Traffic4cast challenges at NeurIPS 2019, 2020, and 2021, this year we will explore models that have the ability to **generalize loosely related temporal vertex data on just a few nodes** to **predict dynamic future traffic states on the edges of the entire road graph**. Specifically, in our core challenge we invite participants to predict for three cities the **congestion classes** known from the red, yellow, or green colouring of roads on a common traffic map for the entire road graph 15min into the future. We provide **car count data from spatially sparse vehicle counters** in these three cities in 15min aggregated time bins for one hour prior to the prediction time slot. For our extended challenge participants are asked to predict the **actual average speeds** on each road segment in the graph 15min into the future.

### Task
Given one hour of sparse loop count data only the task is to predict the congestion
classification (`cc`) for all road segments 15 minutes into the future (green, yellow, and red lines). For the
extended challenge the prediction targets are Travel Times or Expected Times of Arrival (`eta`) along supersegments.

Not only the input data is sparse, but also the ground truth labels are sparse. As GPS fleets comprise only a subset of all vehicles in traffic, many segments cannot be classified from the data without further data assimilation (as in production systems).
Models need to be able to cope with such sparse signal during training while still being able to predict accurately whenever ground truth labels are available. See [Metric](#metric) below.

The ability to predict temporal edge features in graphs from sparse vertex data is a key
concern in real world applications more generally, many of which are critical to the functioning of
our society. Our competition affects research solution approaches to many applications, examples are:
the spread of COVID-19 can be seen as predicting temporal edge features in a large spatio-temporal graph;
malicious software can be identified as anomalous patterns in temporal sequences of evolving multiscaled API graph;
Wide Area Network traffic prediction;
learning the temporal dynamics of crypto-currency networks.



### Data
The GPS data has been aggregated and made available by HERE Technologies as in the previous
instances of Traffic4cast. The data originates from a large fleet of probe vehicles which recorded their movements in the years 2019 to
2021. For this year’s competition we focus on the three cities: London, Madrid and Melbourne.
The underlying raw data is similar to the input for commercial traffic maps and routing
products. Similarly to the previous years, the data will be made available for download from HERE
Technologies. Unlike previous years, this data will serve as input for deriving the ground truth labels
for our core and extended challenge. In addition, participants can use the speed data on the graph
edges for jointly modelling traffic or as labels for intermediate tasks. As mentioned below in the
evaluation data description, we are holding back some time intervals for all three cities.
Traffic loop counter data is the new additional data source for Traffic4cast 2022. Loop counters are
often made publicly available by city or motorway authorities and, lately, an increasing collection
of crowd-sourced data through alternative sensor networks is
becoming widely available. Loop counters are spatially sparse (up to 7000 per city)
but do capture all traffic at their locations. They have no volume bias in contrast to the GPS probe
data which, in turn, are collected by vehicle fleets. We focus on the large
publicly available, loop counter data sets for London, Madrid, and Melbourne. The loop counter
measurements are represented as nodes with measured volumes per 15 minute time bin. The nodes
can be attached to the road graph. We are providing pre-compiled derived data sets as well as tools to
convert or easily load the data.


### Labels
The aggregated GPS probe data are used to generate our ground truth labels. Therefore the 5 minute
time bins in our usual spato-temporal data format are getting aggregated to 15 minutes time bins taking the average speed to our loop counter data. We then derive
the following ground truth labels.

#### Core Challenge: Congestion Class (CC)
Labels in the core competition are congestion classes for each segment in the road graph: red/congested, yellow/warning, green/uncongested.
The class is derived through from the aggregated GPS probe data; if not enough data is available to derive the congestion class, it will output
missing value. For ease of use we will provide the training data as a graph representation.
At test time we provide only the loop counter input and evaluate only against locations where data is available to derive the congestion class.
See [Generate Labels](#generate-labels) for the code used to derive congestion classes.

#### Extended Challenge: Travel Time (ETA) for each supersegment
Labels in the extended competition are travel times (or Expected Time of Arrival, ETA) for each supersegment.
The dynamic speed data (GPS probes) is used to derive travel times on the edges of the graph and then summed up to supersegment ETAs.
This is compatible with how industry-standard routing engines are deriving their segment speeds. The use of supersegments is motivated by contraction hierarchies, which are a common strategy in most commercial routing engines.
Also, the use of supersegments helps to make the ETAs derived from the underlying speed data more robust to data outliers.
At test time we provide only the loop counter input.
See [Generate Labels](#generate-labels) for the code used to derive ETAs.


### Novelty
Traffic4cast 2022 seamlessly connects to and builds on our previous competitions at NeurIPS 2019,
2020 and 2021. It does not reuse any data provided in previous competitions and adds data for two
additional hitherto unused cities (London and Madrid).
Key innotiations in this year’s competition are the following.

**Usage of alternative data sources** It is important to note that our competition challenges do not
ask participants to make predictions into the future on the same data source. Both its challenges
invite participants to make traffic state predictions from sparse loop counter data on road graph edges,
i.e. predict the future dynamics of a different data source. Our competition’s aim is to lower the
technological and financial barrier of entry to making future traffic state predictions of entire cities.
Loop counters are an easily available public data source that encodes much of the complex traffic
dynamics we seek.

**Unique scale.** Our competition data is based on $`10^{12}`$ data points and for the first time allows the
scientific community to study the dynamic link between loop counter data time series and the traffic
state dynamics of entire cities rather than small, non-isolated traffic subsystems.
Our competition thus also represents a unique real-world, large scale graph based prediction problem
that should be of interest to the machine learning community.

### Overview
The following figure shows an overview of the data for the Traffic4cast 2022 Competition at NeurIPS and how it is used in the competition. For legal reasons, participants need to download speed data and generate edge labels from them locally. We provide the script to do that and it will take approx. 45 minutes for cc generation and approx. 90 minutes for eta generation. Node data can be downloaded from AWS from the public links below.

The file `road_graph_supersegments.parquet` contains the list of supersegments for the extended competition along with the list of corresponding nodes.


**submissions**

This folder is empty and will be used by participants for preparing their submissions.


**test**

This folder contains the test inputs for generating a submission,
for more information see https://github.com/iarai/NeurIPS2022-traffic4cast

**movie**
The dynamic traffic map movie data is provided by HERE and can be downloaded from https://developer.here.com/sample-data.
This data needs only be downloaded if participants want to re-write their own mapping to the road graph.

The data for one day is given as a (288,495,436,8) tensor
in a HDF5 file (.h5 suffix). The first 3 dimensions encode the 5-min time bin, height
and width of each "image". The first two of the 8 channels encode the aggregated volume and average speed of all underlying probes whose heading is between 0 and
90 degrees (i.e. NE), the next two the same aggregation of volume and speed for all
probes heading NW, the following two for SE and SW, respectively.


**speed_classes**
The dynamic speed classifications are derived from the traffic map movie data provided by HERE and can be downloaded from https://developer.here.com/sample-data.

Values per 15-minute time bins are given as a columnar table in a Parquet file
(.parquet suffix). The entries in this table can be joined with a fully connected road
graph using the tools provided at https://github.com/iarai/NeurIPS2022-traffic4cast.

**train**

This folder provides the training input data for all three cities.

The subfolder <city>/input contains the loop_counter (see above) information pre-processed
in order to be directly consumable by a data loader.


The subfolder <city>/labels is being generated after downloading the Traffic4cast 2022 datasets
from https://developer.here.com/sample-data and running the label pre-processing script,
for more information see https://github.com/iarai/NeurIPS2022-traffic4cast





For each city, we're using approx. 6 months of data, interleaving training and test data on a weekly basis (1 week of training and 1 week for test):
| City          | Period            |
|---------------|-------------------|
| London        | 2019-07-01 - 2020-01-31 |
| Madrid        | 2021-06-01 - 2021-12-31 |
| Melbourne     | 2020-06-01 - 2020-12-30 |

### Generating Training Labels
The script `t4c22/prepare_training_data_cc.py`/`t4c22/prepare_training_data_eta.py` prepares congestion class/supersemgent eta training labels using speed_classes. This should take less than 45 minutes for cc generation and less than 90 minutes for eta generation.

Prior to starting you should have downloaded and extracted the following 5
ZIP files to the same working data directory (`<working_dir>`):
- LONDON_2022.zip from https://developer.here.com/sample-data
- MADRID_2022.zip from https://developer.here.com/sample-data
- MELBOURNE_2022.zip from https://developer.here.com/sample-data
- T4C_INPUTS_2022.zip from https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=16MDOeCHVIjM9Sy3cvFP-XX8r7LH1gYFQ
- T4C_INPUTS_ETA_2022.zip from https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1n_0_qJqhbFZY4mm2Yj8Q7CqsvsNkobFz



These scripts require the following folders in `<working_dir>`
```
├── road_graph

```



## Metric
### Metric core competition (congestion classes `cc`)
We use masked cross-entropy loss on congestion classes:



$$\ell(\hat{y}, y) = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{\Sigma_{n=1}^N   w_{y_n} \cdot \mathbb{1}\\{y_n \not= \text{ignore}\\\_\text{index}\\}} l_n, \quad
          l_n = - w_{y_n} \log \frac{\hat{y}\_{n,y_n}+\varepsilon}{\Sigma\_{c=0}^{C-1} \hat{y}_{n,c}+\varepsilon} \cdot \mathbb{1}\\{y_n \not= \text{ignore}\\\_\text{index}\\}$$


where
* $\hat{y} \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times C}$ is the input (probabilities, if logits are used, then replace $x_{n,c}$ and $y_n$ by $\exp(x_{n,c})$ and $\exp(y_{n})$ ),
* $y \in \\{0,...,C-1\\}^N$ is the target,
* $w \in \mathbb{R}^C$ is the class weight,
* $C \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of classes,
* $N \in \mathbb{N}$ is the number of samples,
* $\varepsilon \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is small constant preventing overflow in $\log(0)$,
* $\text{ignore}\\\_\text{index} \in C \cup \\{\bot\\}$ specifies a target value that is ignored or none ( $\bot$ ).

Cross-entropy loss will penalize small predicted probabilities disproportionately.

In our setting,
* $C=4$ and $\text{ignore}\\\_\text{index}=0$, i.e., we always **mask** on unclassified edges in ground truth
  * 0 = unclassified
  * 1 = green (uncongested)
  * 2 = yellow (slowed down)
  * 3 = red (congest)
* $N$ goes over edges and timestamps
* $w$ macro averaging: $w_c = \frac{N}{|C| \cdot \Sigma_{i=1}^N{   \mathbb{1} \\{y_i = c\\} }}$ for $c \in C$ simply calculates the mean for each ground truth class, giving equal weight to each class ([scikit multiclas classification](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#multiclass-and-multilabel-classification)). In problems where infrequent classes are nonetheless important, macro-averaging may be a means of highlighting their performance.  In our case, since we have more red than yellow than green in all cities and since we're interested in capturing congested situations well, we take this approach.

We provide
* the weights $w$ for each city
* average the macro-averaged city scores of the 3 cities to get an overall score.

### Metric extended competition (supersegment travel times `eta`)
We use [L1 Loss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.L1Loss.html) for the extended competitions. Notice that in contrast to the core competitions, there is no "evaluation mask", i.e. all supersegments have an ETA label.

## Test set

### Test set core competition (congestion classification `cc`)
We will restrict evaluation to a subset 6am-10pm (including weekends).
However, all data can be used for training.

We are providing the code we use for evaluation and code to generate own validation sets.

### Test set extended competition (supersegment travel times `eta`)
We use the exactly same test set for the extended competition as for the core competition (same input files `test/<city>/input/counters_test.parquet`)

## Data loaders
We provide a plain torch and torch geometric data loader, see `t4c22.dataloading` and the working examples under `exploration`.


## Baselines (forthcoming)
The tasks can be tackled in many ways, from GNN to attention-based to working on the grid (movies).

In the mean-time, see the examples under `exploration` with working data loading.

We thus reinterpreted the challenge of forecasting traffic conditions as a movie completion task. U-Nets proved to be the winning architecture, demonstrating an ability to extract relevant features in this complex real-world geo-spatial process. Building on the previous competitions, Traffic4cast 2021 now focuses on the question of model robustness and generalizability across time and space. Moving from one city to an entirely different city, or moving from pre-COVID times to times after COVID hit the world thus introduces a clear domain shift. We thus, for the first time, release data featuring such domain shifts. The competition now covers ten cities over 2 years, providing data compiled from over $10^{12}$ GPS probe data. Winning solutions captured traffic dynamics sufficiently well to even cope with these complex domain shifts. Surprisingly, this seemed to require only the previous 1h traffic dynamic history and static road graph as input. }

The IARAI Traffic4cast challenge at NeurIPS 2020 build on the insights of the previous year and sought to both challenge some assumptions inherent in our 2019 competition design and explore how far this neural network technique can be pushed. We found that the  prediction horizon can be extended successfully to 60 minutes into the future, that there is further evidence that traffic depends more on recent dynamics than on the additional static or dynamic location specific data provided and that a reasonable starting point when exploring a general aggregated geo-spatial process in time and space is a U-net architecture.}

  abstract =      {Deep Neural Networks models are state-of-the-art solutions in accurately forecasting future video frames in a movie.  A successful video prediction model needs to extract and encode semantic features that describe the complex spatio-temporal correlations within image sequences of the real world.  The IARAI Traffic4cast Challenge of the NeurIPS Competition Track 2019 for the first time introduced the novel argument that this is also highly relevant for urban traffic. By framing traffic prediction as a movie completion task, the challenge requires models to take advantage of complex geo-spatial and temporal patterns of the underlying process. We here report on the success and insights obtained in a first Traffic Map Movie forecasting challenge. Although short-term traffic prediction is considered hard, this novel approach allowed several research groups to successfully predict future traffic states in a purely data-driven manner from pixel space. We here expand on the original rationale, summarize key findings, and discuss promising future directions of the t4c competition at NeurIPS.}
